        <p class="text-overview">Here are some photos and more information about Dom's hobbies. Dom started his mixed martial arts hobby in
          2020 when regular gyms were closed down. He trained for one year and competed in four matches over the next
          year, where he won two USA boxing matches. He then picked up BJJ and Kickboxing and has been training for
          about two and a half years. After two years of training in Kickboxing, he took a K1 kickboxing bout and earned
          a unanimous decision victory. He is also hoping to get promoted to blue belt in BJJ soon. Dom has also been
          studying Japanese for two and a half years now and has learned two thousand Kanji and six thousand words in
          the last year. He hopes to one day travel to Japan to learn about the culture and hone his Japanese language
          studies. Dom has also bouldered for about a year and quickly developed his climbing skills up to the V7 grade.
          Enjoy the photos below showcasing some of Dom's hobbies.</p>
