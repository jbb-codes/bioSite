          Dominic, or Dom for short, is goal-oriented and has achieved several goals that he set out to accomplish.
          After
          graduating high school, he pursued a degree in Computer Science at the University of William & Mary, which he
          completed,
          and went on to work as a Software Developer. Since he started his career, he has continued to develop his
          skill sets. He
          has held the software engineering analyst, senior software engineer, and software engineer specialist
          positions. He is
          now looking to become a software engineering manager. It is apparent that he has led a successful career and
          seeks to
          continue his career growth by continuing to challenge himself to learn and improve.
          On another note, Dominic has several interesting hobbies, from mixed martial arts fighting styles, including
          boxing,
          kickboxing, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu(BJJ), to studying Japanese. One of the more recent hobbies that he picked
          up is
          bouldering, in which he gained the technique and strength needed to progress quickly as a climber. Between
          working and
          the wide range of hobbies that he is involved in, he has to strategically decide what he chooses to put his
          effort into.
          Although this man should have plenty of energy as he likes having two Monster Energy drinks a day, the Zero
          Ultra is his
          preference. He still finds time to do things he enjoys that are not as intense in his downtime, like playing
          video games
          and studying Japanese. With this brief overview of his accomplishments and interests, Dominic is one
          interesting man.
