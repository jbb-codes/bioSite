      <p class="text-overview">
        Dominic is a native Tennessean, born and raised. He has moved around and lived in several different places, but
        he has now returned to his roots and come home where the rest of his family is, and they are thankful he is
        back. When Dom was young, he thought he would grow up to be a lawyer, but as with most things, this changed, and
        he went in a different direction. He attended William and Mary University and decided to pursue a degree in
        Computer Science. He claims his cousin's interest in computer science encouraged him to go in that direction,
        but his interest in video games growing up may have also played a part in his interest in a technology career.
        After completing his undergraduate studies and receiving his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, his search
        for a position in a technology role began. In time, he landed his first role as a Software Engineering Analyst.
        He has since stayed with the same company and has held the titles Senior Software Engineer and Software Engineer
        Specialist. During all of this, he has had several hobbies that he has been involved in, some old and some new.
        As mentioned earlier, Dom developed an interest in video games when he was young, and it remains a hobby in his
        adult life; he likes to play when he can for leisure. One of his newer interests is studying the Japanese
        language. He has been developing this skill for about two and a half years. He has learned two thousand Kanji
        and six thousand words in the last year. Dom says there are "three pillars of learning a language: listening,
        speaking, and writing". He practices methods that include using YouTube to listen to Japanese and gain
        familiarity with the language being spoken, writing Kanji, and working on pronouncing words while he writes.
        This is just a short biography to give you more insight into Dominic's life and interests. To learn more about
        him, visit the Hobbies page.
